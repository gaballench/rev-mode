# rev-mode
A GNU Emacs interpreter mode for the rev language of evolutionary bayesian inference

This mode aims at interpreting `rev` code for use in `revbayes` under Emacs. It is a fork of `S-mode` with modification for handling syntax highlight, auto-completion, and command redirection in order to provide a development environment for `revbayes`. Please see the original code in the `s-mode` directory for further details and attribution.
